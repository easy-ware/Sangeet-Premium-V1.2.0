Welcome to Sangeet - Build with Docker
Here’s how to build and use the Sangeet Docker image for your platform. Follow the steps below based on your needs!

1. Build for Your Current Platform
Command:
docker build -t custom_name_to_image .
Alternative (using default name):
docker build -t sangeet-premiumv1.2.0:local .
What it does: This builds a Docker image for the platform you're currently using (e.g., your computer's architecture, like amd64 or arm64).
Explanation:
- docker build: The basic command to create a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
- -t custom_name_to_image: Tags the image with a name you choose (e.g., my-sangeet). Replace custom_name_to_image with your preferred name.
- -t sangeet-pre: Uses a default name, sangeet-pre, if you don’t want to customize it.
- .: Tells Docker to use the Dockerfile in the current directory.

2. Use a Prebuilt Image
Command:
docker pull tetsingimagesnet/sangeet-premiumv1.2.0:dev

Additional Tips
- Run the Image: After building or loading, start a container with:
  docker run -it custom_name_to_image
  (Replace custom_name_to_image with the name you used.)
- Prerequisites: Ensure Docker is installed and, for multi-platform builds, Docker Buildx is set up (see Step 2 instructions).
